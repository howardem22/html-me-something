        <p>My last page attempt wasn't working as well as I had hoped. So, on to the backup plan it is!!</p>
        <p>I was going to do a page about some of the places I had been in China, but I couldn't get the pictures the work properly.</p>
        <p>That leaves me with not a lot of options, because I'm not really the creative type.</p>
        <p>The only thing I'm still having a problem with for this assignment is the HTML entity. So here's the yen symbol I was going to use in the last version: &yen;</p>
