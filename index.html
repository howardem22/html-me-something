        <h2>Parks in Yingkou</h2>
        <p>One of my favortie things about China was the parks. I did not spend a lot of time in Yingkou, but I did spend most of my time there wandering around the parks.</p>

        <p>My favorite park in Yingkou was Mirror Lake Park. At least, that is what my friend said its name was. </p>

        <p>I never learned the actual name of this park. It was prettier in the daylight, but much livelier at night.</p>

        <p>I love the parks by the water. This was the prettiest park at sunset. I call it Seaside Park because it is right at the mouth of the river going into the gulf.</p>

        <p>This one I knew translated to Forest Park. What didn't translate was the grid pattern the trees were planted in. A "forest" shouldn't be that manicured.</p>
        <img src="RenminPark1.jpg" alt="Peacock at Renmin Park">
        <p>Every city I was in had a "Renmin Park" (or People's Park). And most of the ones I went to were also a zoo. Sort of.</p>
        <p>Best part of getting to all these parks was the bus fare was &yen;1.</p>
